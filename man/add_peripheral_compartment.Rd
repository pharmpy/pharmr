\description{
Add a peripheral distribution compartment to model

The rate of flow from the central to the peripheral compartment
will be parameterized as QPn / VC where VC is the volume of the central compartment.
The rate of flow from the peripheral to the central compartment
will be parameterized as QPn / VPn where VPn is the volumne of the added peripheral
compartment.
